## üì¶ Installation

Docker support should arrive soon.

1. **Clone the repository**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/etienne-hd/tgtg-finder.git
  cd tgtg-finder
  ```

2. **Install dependencies**
  It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

A [config.py](config.py) file is provided by default in the project.

It contains the basic parameters for running the TooGoodToGo client. Here's an overview of its contents:

```python
IOS_VERSION = "18.5"
IPHONE_MODEL = "15"
COUNTRY_CODE = "FR"
BASE_URL = "https://apptoogoodtogo.com/api"
POLLING_TIMEOUT = 120  # seconds to wait for email confirmation
POLLING_SLEEP_TIME = 5  # delay between each polling attempt
```

You can adjust values like `IOS_VERSION` or `POLLING_TIMEOUT` as needed.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. **Run the script**
  Here's an example of how to use the client in a script:

  ```python
  from api import Client, Bag
  from api.logger import logger
  
  import time
  import random
  
  def trigger_webhook(bag: Bag):
      logger.info(f"{bag.display_name} - {bag.items_available}")
  
  def main():
      email = "you@example.com"
      client = Client()
  
      client.login(email=email)
      if not client.is_connected:
          logger.warning("Client login failed: not connected.")
          return
      
      logger.info("Client successfully connected. Starting favorite bag     monitoring...")
  
      while True:
          try:
              bags = client.get_favorites()
              logger.info(f"Retrieved {len(bags)} favorite bags.")
  
              for bag in bags:
                  if bag.items_available > 0:
                      trigger_webhook(bag=bag)
          except Exception as e:
              logger.exception(f"Error while retrieving favorite bags: {e}")
              time.sleep(60)
          time.sleep(random.randint(30, 60)) # Recommended time to avoid 403    errors
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

2. **Automate notifications (optional)**
  You can integrate your own notification system (email, Discord webhook, Telegram bot, etc.) using the `bag.item.items_available` attribute to detect when new stock appears.
  Take a look at the [examples](examples/).
